# Crack-Segmentation
Binary semantic segmentation for asphalt cracks

## 1. Notes

    This is a framework for the binary semantic segmentation of asphalt cracks implemented on PyTorch. 
    The model Architecture is MAnet and the encoder is mit_b5.

## 2. Train

The code that was used for training the models is available at [train.ipynb](https://github.com/amirhosseinghdv/Crack-Segmentation/blob/main/train.ipynb) .
